### User Story   
As a user I want to be able to play Mad Libs words games! When I login then I am presented with additional options on the dashboard and a session is saved. When I click play then I am presented with a menu of Mad Libs templates to choose from. When I click a template option then I am prompted to enter words of a particular part of speech or category. When I  enter all of the words needed to complete the story then I am prompted to “generate template”. When I click “generate template” then I am presented with a completed Mad Libs story that includes the words that I inputted. When I am done reading my completed story, then I have the option to save that story or play again. When I choose to save my story  then I am taken to the “view saved” page. On the “view saved” tab I can view all completed stories that I chose to save (belonging to me as the user), I also have the option to delete saved stories. When I choose to play again, then I am routed back to the menu. When I click the “word bank” tab on the dashboard then I am routed to the “word bank” page. When I click logout, then the session is ended and my dashboard options revert back to “Homepage” and “login”.
